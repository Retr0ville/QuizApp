# QuizApp
Quiz App submission for the GoogleAfricaScholarshipChallenge #7DaysOfCodeChallenge.

My quiz app was created to test users knowledge of some basic information pertaining to the Java programming language. 
It included 10 questions, that is, five questions that accepts radio button inputs,
three that take Checkbox inputs and two free text inputs,
on submitting the app displays a congratulatory message that varies depending on how well you performed, 
alongside with your score, it does this via a toast as demanded by the course.
